                            <p> Digitization is the process of converting information into a digital format . In this format,
                                information is organized into discrete units of data (called bit s) that can be separately
                                addressed (usually in multiple-bit groups called byte s). This is the binary data that computers
                                and many devices with computing capacity (such as digital camera s and digital hearing aid
                                s) can process. Text and images can be digitized similarly: a scanner captures an image (which
                                may be an image of text) and converts it to an image file, such as a bitmap . An optical
                                character recognition ( OCR ) program analyzes a text image for light and dark areas in order
                                to identify each alphabetic letter or numeric digit, and converts each character into an
                                ASCII code.

                                <p> Audio and video digitization uses one of many analog-to-digital conversion processes in which
                                    a continuously variable ( analog ) signal is changed, without altering its essential
                                    content, into a multi-level (digital) signal. The process of sampling measures the amplitude
                                    (signal strength) of an analog waveform at evenly spaced time markers and represents
                                    the samples as numerical values for input as digital data.

                                <p> Digitizing information makes it easier to preserve, access, and share. For example, an original
                                    historical document may only be accessible to people who visit its physical location,
                                    but if the document content is digitized, it can be made available to people worldwide.
                                    There is a growing trend towards digitization of historically and culturally significant
                                    data.

                                    Your organisation will need to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset and embed it in its culture. Your staff are already using
                                    digital technologies to make gradual but significant changes to their daily lives as
                                    consumers, they are going to expect the same as employees. They will have ideas. Leading
                                    digital companies are trying out digital technologies to revolutionise the way employees
                                    collaborate and communicate. They are also ensuring that digital ideas are captured,
                                    prioritised and harnessed. Let your employees know that from now on, you want them to
                                    think and act like digital start entrepreneurs and to bring ideas and then ensure you
                                    have governance that invests in those ideas.

                                    When building digital solutions, it is best to build a digital platform upon which, new code is written but which interfaces
                                    to all key services in legacy and 3rd party applications. The platform should interface
                                    to all social networking platforms and support engagement with customers through any
                                    channel and any device. It should also be cloud based and built to capture the huge amount
                                    of information generated in a digitally enabled business. A data analysis engine should
                                    be part of the digital platform using appropriate Big Data databases and both real time
                                    and batch based analytics so your organisation can respond to real time transactions/postings
                                    being made by your customers but also to analyse the huge amounts of digital information
                                    to lean new and interesting emerging trends and business insights.
